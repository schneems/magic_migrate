These docs are [intended to be read on docs.rs](https://docs.rs/magic_migrate/latest/magic_migrate/).

## What

Let's say that you made a struct that serializes to disk somehow; perhaps it uses toml. Now, let's say you want to add a new field to that struct but want to keep older persisted data. Whatever should you do?

You can define how to convert from one struct to another using either [`From`] or [`TryFrom`], then tell Rust how to migrate from one to the next via [`Migrate`] or [`TryMigrate`] traits. Now, when you try to load data into the current struct, it will follow a chain of structs in reverse order to find the first one that successfully serializes. When that happens, it will convert that struct to the latest version for you. It's magic! (Actually, it's mostly clever use of trait boundaries, but whatever).

## Docs

For additional docs, see:

- Traits:
    - [`Migrate`] trait for infallible migrations
    - [`TryMigrate`] trait for failable migrations

- TOML Chain macros: Specify the order of structs in the migration chain for TOML data.
    - [`migrate_toml_chain`] macro for infallible migrations of TOML data
    - [`try_migrate_toml_chain`] macro for fallible migrations of TOML data. Requires an additional error struct.

- BYO deserializer macros:
    - [`migrate_deserializer_chain`] macro for infallible migrations, BYO Deserializer
    - [`try_migrate_deserializer_chain`] macro for fallible migrations, BYO Deserializer. Requires an additional error struct.

## Fallible [`TryMigrate`] Example with [`try_migrate_deserializer_chain`]

Once defined, invoke migrations via the `try_from_str_migrations` associated function on the struct you wish to deserialize to.

To define migrations you can use a macro like this:

```ignore
use magic_migrate::{TryMigrate, try_migrate_deserializer_chain};
use serde::de::Deserializer;

// ...

try_migrate_deserializer_chain!(
    deserializer: toml::Deserializer::new,
    error: PersonMigrationError,
    chain: [PersonV1, PersonV2],
);
```

- `deserializer:` The argument should be a function that takes an `&str` and returns `impl Deserialize<'de>`. To deserialize TOML you can use the `toml` crate and specify the `toml::Deserializer::new` function.
- `error:` The error enum used when deserialization fails. Every `TryFrom` should return an error that defines an `Into` for this provided error.
- `chain:` An ordered list of structs from left to right that you wish to migrate between. Each pair of structs must define it's own `TryFrom` separately. In this case, only a `TryFrom<PersonV1> for PersonV2` is needed.

Full example:

```rust
use magic_migrate::{TryMigrate, try_migrate_deserializer_chain};
use serde::de::Deserializer;

use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};
use chrono::{DateTime, Utc};
use std::convert::Infallible;

#[derive(Deserialize, Serialize, Debug)]
#[serde(deny_unknown_fields)]
struct PersonV1 {
    name: String
}

#[derive(Deserialize, Serialize, Debug)]
#[serde(deny_unknown_fields)]
struct PersonV2 {
    name: String,
    updated_at: DateTime<Utc>
}
try_migrate_deserializer_chain!( // <=========== HERE
    deserializer: toml::Deserializer::new,
    error: PersonMigrationError,
    chain: [PersonV1, PersonV2],
);

impl TryFrom<PersonV1> for PersonV2 {
    type Error = NotRichard;

    fn try_from(value: PersonV1) -> Result<Self, NotRichard> {
        if &value.name == "Schneems" {
            Ok(PersonV2 {
                    name: value.name.clone(),
                    updated_at: Utc::now()
               })
        } else {
            Err(NotRichard { name: value.name.clone() })
        }
    }
}

#[derive(Debug, Eq, PartialEq)]
struct NotRichard {
  name: String
}

impl From<NotRichard> for PersonMigrationError {
    fn from(value: NotRichard) -> Self {
        PersonMigrationError::NotRichard(value)
    }
}

#[derive(Debug, thiserror::Error, Eq, PartialEq)]
enum PersonMigrationError {
    #[error("Not Richard {0:?}")]
    NotRichard(NotRichard),
}

// Create a V2 struct from V1 data
let person: PersonV2 = PersonV2::try_from_str_migrations("name = 'Schneems'").unwrap().unwrap();
assert_eq!(person.name, "Schneems".to_string());
```

Protip: You can reduce code churn by creating a type alias to your most recent struct in the chain. For example:

```ignore
pub(crate) type Person = PersonV2;
```

## Why

This library was created to handle the case of serialized metadata stored in layers in a <https://github.com/heroku/libcnb.rs> buildpack as toml.

In this use case, structs are serialized to disk when the Cloud Native Buildpack (CNB) is run. Usually, these values represent the application cache state and are important for cache invalidations.

The buildpack implementer has no control over how often the buildpack is run. That means there's no guarantee the end user will run it with sequential struct versions. One user might run with the latest struct version serialized, and another might use a version from years ago.

This scenario happens in the wild with <https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-ruby> (a "classic" buildpack i.e. not CNB).

Instead of forcing the programmer to consider all possible cache states at all times, a "migration" approach allows programmers to focus on a single cache state change at a time. Which reduces programmer cognitive overhead and (hopefully) reduces bugs.

## What won't it do? (The ABA problem)

This library cannot ensure that if a `PersonV1` struct was serialized, it cannot be loaded into `PersonV2` without migration. I.e. it does not guarantee that the [`From`] or [`TryFrom`] code was run.

For example, if the `PersonV2` struct introduced an `Option<String>` field, instead of `DateTime<Utc>` then the string `"name = 'Richard'"` could be deserialized to either PersonV1 or PersonV2 without needing to call a migration.

- [serde-rs/serde issue trying to use `tag` and `deny_unknown_fields`](https://github.com/serde-rs/serde/issues/2666)

## What can you do to harden your code against this (ABA) issue?

- Use [deny_unknown_fields](https://serde.rs/container-attrs.html) from serde. This setting prevents silently dropping additional struct fields. This strategy would handle the case where V1 has two fields and V2 has only one field [playground example](https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&mode=debug&edition=2021&gist=75c6f06234e1d64aea7b37c448321abf). However, it will **not** protect the case where we've added an optional field, [playground example](https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&mode=debug&edition=2021&gist=47dde9f52b0c5114ef28f35bb019969c).
- Add tests that ensure one struct cannot deserialize into a later one in the chain. Writing tests might be difficult if your structs have many optional fields and you want to generate permutations of all of them.
- Add a [version marker field](https://stackoverflow.com/a/77700752/147390). This strategy works, but you must notice and keep the field name updated when creating a new struct (possible programmer error). And it will leak an implementation detail to anyone who might see your serialized data (which may or may not matter) to you.
- Read these docs and understand the underlying reason why this happens.
- If you have another suggestion to harden a codebase, open an issue.

## Other possible "migration" solutions and their differences

- Using Serde's [container attributes from and try_from](https://serde.rs/container-attrs.html). This feature only works if you never want to store and deserialize the latest version in the chain. [playground example showing you when this fails](https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&mode=debug&edition=2021&gist=b6ea1cd054bab5d7df62a04cbd7c6284).

Compared to using Serde's `from` and `try_from` container attribute features, magic migrate will always try to convert to the target struct first, then migrate using the latest possible struct in the chain, allowing structs to migrate through the entire chain or storing and using the latest value.

- The [Serde version crate](https://docs.rs/serde-version/latest/serde_version/) seems to have overlapping goals. Differences are unclear. If you've tried it, update these docs.
